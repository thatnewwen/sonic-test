          Sonic is defined by speed. As a way to prove the Sega Genesis’ power relative to Nintendo and Mario, Sonic had
          to be fast personified. In an era where entertainment and value were defined by bits, Sega set out to make
          Sonic’s default speed the same as Mario’s running speed. Where does this put the player, who inherits this
          speed? (And also inherits this console war?)
        </p>
        <p>
          Sonic sometimes goes too fast to comprehend. He runs into an enemy you couldn’t have seen, because you were
          going too fast, or falls off a cliff that wasn’t on the horizon a second ago. (The fast stages are often
          designed so you can fall to a lower platform, the slower stages…are just not fun.) <b>Sonic the Hedgehog</b>
          introduces the concept of too fast in a genre that doesn’t usually encourage “too” anything. When the
          expectation is pinpoint accuracy, there is a thrill to losing control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Platformers, and most games, are all about control. It’s how the the player interacts with the form, the
          precision to jump from one platform to another or dodge enemies and evade obstacles. What does it mean to
          tease beyond that, to provide a glimpse of what can’t be controlled or can be barely controlled. How should
          the player feel when this relationship shifts?
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s also the meta-gaming way to assert control. As with many platformers of the time, the levels were
          often designed to be replayed over and over again, allowing failure and repetition to guide the players to
          learn patterns and memorize level designs. Here, it gives players a level of control even if Sonic is too
          fast, extending beyond the bounds of the virtual world to see future moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Granted, this is all more a feeling than a mechanic reality. Sonic isn’t sloppy to control, and with some
          practice, it’s not too hard to understand the momentum at play and utilize it with accuracy. Nor are most of
          the levels really that fast, and some are sluggish to the detriment of the game. But Sonic in the hands of the
          player always feels fast, he always feels like speed. There is this thrill to Sonic when he’s shooting through
          Green Hill Zone or bouncing around like a pinball, where your controls might be slipping just a bit from the
          speed. So fast it raises the question of how in control do we want to be?
